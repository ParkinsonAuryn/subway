            <p>
                In terms of Intended purpose, this site is a personal portfolio perhaps to be sent away to potential employers or a steping stone for this mans portfolio.
            </p>

            <p>
                I must say this site loads exceptionally fast which compliments his skills with web development. It's not particularly interactive which often suits a 								portfolio website. The links however work fine, that includes twitter. Overall I think it fits a web developers portfolio very well if he where a graphic designer I think it's too plain.
            </p>

            <p>
               Aesthetically the web developer has a good eye for subtle things like a lighter typeface for body paragraphs. Since this website only includes one image I think its fair to say he choose a complimentary colourscheme to the blending colours he uses in his sub headings such as WHO? I think this website, particularly the scroll bar which just works with the text quite fitting to a web developers portfolio, perhaps live links to his prior projects would be appropriate as thats usually the first question a client asks of.

            <h3>Saxons Place <a href="https://saxons.place/" class="fa fa-tag"></a></h3>

            <p>
                I think its appropriate to compare two portfolio websites. This website is certainly aimed at presenting this artists illustrations over his qualifications. This is a definitive contact sheet included at the footer which means this is certainly intended for live use on the web.

            </p>

            <p>
                If Im being honest I perceived the moving backgrounds and imagery around the subheadings as interactive buttons, for this reason I think it doesnt quite fit the intended purpose of presenting his portfolio. Upon clicking on each photo there was a lag time between a jolty larger version of the image loading which doesnt compliment the immersion the web developer initally grabs your interest with.

            </p>

             <p>
                Aesthetically this website is gorgeous, upon deeper investigation I found some illustrations to have moving qualities to them, even if they were just shifts in colour. The type is certainly quirkey and casual which compliments this artists work. Over all fantastic theme to it.

            <p>
                In terms of web-safe colours many web designs opt to use these because they're universal, every computer will be able to render one of the choosen 216 web safe colours as apposed to a discoloured anomoly. I found this website to have done just that, Im quite sure of this because the website is dutch and I was prompted for a well translated option upon loading the website. Colours such as Matte Grey which is used for the subheading I believe to be #222222 are also easy on the eye for extended periods of reading.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've discovered image formats such as .png and .gif are suitable for web design because of the sheer small size of the files. Brenners Website uses .jpeg files from what I could find out. A smaller file size means a website will load faster in the browser.
            </p>

            <p>
                Web fonts are not pre installed on most computer systems, they come from a third party cdn like Googlefonts and a system font from what Ive gathered uses raster graphics which if zoomed in distorts the text. This website maintains its font size even zoomed in at 500%. I can interestingly give an example of a raster graphics system font because the brenner cycles logo becomes distorted upon zooming in by 500%.

            <p>
                The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a standard for describing the structure and presentation of
                information via the Internet. Scott Loban shows how you can use HTML keywords and tags to format and
                display the content of Web pages. Distinguishing features now include Video, Canvas, Application caches
                and Geolocation.

            <p>
                Though it is a language almost identical to HTML, XHTML is in fact a hybrid language - it is a
                combination of HTML and XML. XML is a markup language where everything must be marked up correctly with
                tags resulting in what are called "well-formed" documents, it is a language used to describe data. HTML
                is a markup language used to display content on webpages, it is a language used to display data.

            <h3>DHTML</h3>

            <p>
                Dynamic HTML is not really a new specification of HTML, but rather a new way of looking at and
                controlling the standard HTML codes and commands. When thinking of dynamic HTML, you need to remember
                the qualities of standard HTML, especially that once a page is loaded from the server, it will not
                change until another request comes to the server. Dynamic HTML give you more control over the HTML
                elements and allows them to change at any time, without returning to the Web server. <a

            <h3>Purpose and Ditinguishing Features</h3>

            <p>
                An FTP Client is a software designed to transfer files back-and-forth between two computers over the
                Internet. It needs to be installed on your computer and can only be used with a live connection to the
                Internet. To transfer a file with FTP you need to have an FTP accounts for the web space you are going
                to transfer the file to. FTP hosting account where you plan to upload your files. You can also create
                additional for other users. When using a web browser for an FTP connection, FTP uploads are sometimes
                very slow, and downloads are not protected (not recommended for uploading or downloading large files).
                FTP clients' interface is usually divided in two - the pane on the left shows the files and folders on
                your computer (your Desktop, My Documents, etc,) and the pane on the right displays the files on the
                remote server.

            <h3>What is a Webmail Client and It's Storage Space</h3>

            <p>
                Webmail (or web-based email) is any email client implemented as a web application running on a web server. Examples of webmail software are Roundcube and SquirrelMail. Examples of webmail providers are AOL Mail, Gmail, Outlook.com and Yahoo! Mail. With Gmail for example, Users can buy additional storage, shared among Gmail, Google Drive and Google+ Photos, through a monthly subscription plan. As of 2015, storage of up to 15 GB is free, and paid plans are available for up to 30 TB for personal use.

            <h3>Composition Features</h3>

            <p>
                Gmail's user interface designer, Kevin Fox, intended users to feel as if they were always on one page and just changing things on that page, rather than having to navigate to other places.Gmail's interface also makes use of 'labels' (tags) – that replace the conventional folders and provide a more flexible methods of organizing email, filters for automatically organizing, deleting or forwarding incoming emails to other addresses, and importance makers for automatically marking messages as 'important'.

            <h3>Delivery Features and Additional</h3>

            <p>
                Gmail includes a range of helpful features, these include, If you cycle through a lot of messages at once, it's probably really annoying that Gmail takes you back to the inbox whenever you delete, archive, or mute a conversation. The Auto-Advance feature, available in Gmail Labs, lets you choose what Gmail does in this situation, so you can go straight to the next (or previous) email whenever you delete or archive a message. Or Gmail has quite a few labs that let you preview things like videos, documents, voicemails, and images in emails if they're sent from certain services. For example, if one of your contacts sends you a message with an address in it, the Google Maps Preview Lab will automatically show you that address on a map.

            <h3>Seller Facilities Comparison with eCommerce Websites</h3>

            <p>
                The two most popular platforms Shopify and Bigcommerce both charge around $30 for their services. the cheapest plan offered on any of the platforms is without competition offered on Big Cartel, this package doesn’t cost a single dime. In general when looking at the pricing of Big Cartel you can see that even their most expensive plan costs as much as the cheapest plan with Shopify or BigCommerce. When you compare the middle pricing packages you can quickly see that there seems to be some sort of agreement that the price should be somewhere between $65 and $80.

            <p>
                That said, if you take a look at a comparison on Google trends, Shopify is the clear winner in terms of what people are searching and how many people are showing interest in the five popular consumer solutions. The 3dcart platform is, and has always been, at the bottom in terms of trending on Google. It’s interesting to point out that Bigcommerce has made a recent surge. Shopify has it all in terms of an easy setup, with a handy dashboard area for quickly adding products, customizing the look of your site and more. It’s cool because Shopify asks you if you plan on moving from another platform during the signup process. The system then provides a link for importing products from your previous store. Where as the 3dcart product setup page is the oldest looking of the bunch. It’s not that the module is confusing, but the junky design makes you wonder if they’ve updated it in a while.

Compared to Shopify and Bigcommerce, the collection of themes offered by 3dcart or Big Cartel shouldn’t even be mentioned in the same sentence. In fact, Bigcommerce themes are pretty remarkable, and as of March 23, 2016, around 67 new and responsive themes are being released for $145 to $235.

            <h3>How it Works</h3>

            <p>
                Voice over IP (VoIP) is a methodology and group of technologies for the delivery of voice communications and multimedia sessions over Internet Protocol (IP) networks, such as the Internet. <a
                    href="http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/41620/dns" class="fa fa-tag"></a>

        <div class=" block-221 ">

            <h3>Hardware requirements</h3>

            <p>
                IP Phones and VoIP telephone adapters connect to routers or cable modems which typically depend on the availability of mains electricity or locally generated power.[30] Some VoIP service providers use customer premises equipment (e.g., cablemodems) with battery-backed power supplies to assure uninterrupted service for up to several hours in case of local power failures. Such battery-backed devices typically are designed for use with analog handsets.

            <h3>Popular software for VOIP</h3>

            <p>
                Alcatel, Avaya and Nortel are traditional suppliers with a heritage of legacy products that migrated to IP, they're trying to keep their existing customers in the fold by offering IP PBXes that carry VoIP. Companies like 3Com also focused heavily on hardware-based voice communications, while at the lower end of the enterprise market, you'll find organisations like Mitel, Suretel, and Panasonic.

            <h3>Benefits of VOIP Over Traditional Telephony</h3>

            <p>
                Internet telephony does more than increase savings by lowering costs. It also enables the user to integrate software programs, such as e-mail, e-fax, and remote conferencing over the Internet via the telephone. In other words, a VoIP user can speak to somebody over the phone while accessing other applications, including the Internet simultaneously. VoIP installation requires little technical know-how. In fact, the easy installation process and mobility of the VoIP system offers a high advantage over traditional telephones. Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology can increase the overall productivity of an organization by allowing their employees to multi-task without interruption.

            <h3>Adobe Flash Software and History</h3>

            <p>
                Adobe Flash (formerly called Macromedia Flash and Shockwave Flash) is a multimedia and software platform
                used for creating vector graphics, animation, browser games, rich Internet applications, desktop
                applications, mobile applications and mobile games. Flash displays text, vector and raster graphics to
                provide animations, video games and applications. It allows streaming of audio and video, and can
                capture mouse, keyboard, microphone and camera input.

            <h3>Flash Video and Usability Issues</h3>

            <p>
                Flash Video is a container file format used to deliver video over the Internet using Adobe Flash Player
                version 6 and newer. The reliance on Adobe for decoding Flash makes its use on the World Wide Web a
                concern—the completeness of its public specifications are debated, and no complete implementation of
                Flash is publicly available in source code form with a license that permits reuse. Generally, public
                specifications are what makes a format re-implementable (see future proofing data storage), and reusable
                codebases can be ported to new platforms without the endorsement of the format creator. Flash content is
                usually embedded using the object or embed HTML element. A web browser that does not fully implement one
                of these elements displays the replacement text, if supplied by the web page. Often, a plugin is
                required for the browser to fully implement these elements.
