            <h3>How it Works</h3>

            <p>
                Voice over IP (VoIP) is a methodology and group of technologies for the delivery of voice communications and multimedia sessions over Internet Protocol (IP) networks, such as the Internet. <a

            <h3>Hardware requirements</h3>

            <p>
                IP Phones and VoIP telephone adapters connect to routers or cable modems which typically depend on the availability of mains electricity or locally generated power.[30] Some VoIP service providers use customer premises equipment (e.g., cablemodems) with battery-backed power supplies to assure uninterrupted service for up to several hours in case of local power failures. Such battery-backed devices typically are designed for use with analog handsets.

            <h3>Popular software for VOIP</h3>

            <p>
                Alcatel, Avaya and Nortel are traditional suppliers with a heritage of legacy products that migrated to IP, they're trying to keep their existing customers in the fold by offering IP PBXes that carry VoIP. Companies like 3Com also focused heavily on hardware-based voice communications, while at the lower end of the enterprise market, you'll find organisations like Mitel, Suretel, and Panasonic.

            <h3>Benefits of VOIP Over Traditional Telephony</h3>

            <p>
                Internet telephony does more than increase savings by lowering costs. It also enables the user to integrate software programs, such as e-mail, e-fax, and remote conferencing over the Internet via the telephone. In other words, a VoIP user can speak to somebody over the phone while accessing other applications, including the Internet simultaneously. VoIP installation requires little technical know-how. In fact, the easy installation process and mobility of the VoIP system offers a high advantage over traditional telephones. Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology can increase the overall productivity of an organization by allowing their employees to multi-task without interruption.
