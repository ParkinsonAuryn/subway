            <p>
                In terms of Intended purpose, this site is a personal portfolio perhaps to be sent away to potential employers or a steping stone for this mans portfolio.
            </p>

            <p>
                I must say this site loads exceptionally fast which compliments his skills with web development. It's not particularly interactive which often suits a 								portfolio website. The links however work fine, that includes twitter. Overall I think it fits a web developers portfolio very well if he where a graphic designer I think it's too plain.
            </p>

            <p>
               Aesthetically the web developer has a good eye for subtle things like a lighter typeface for body paragraphs. Since this website only includes one image I think its fair to say he choose a complimentary colourscheme to the blending colours he uses in his sub headings such as WHO? I think this website, particularly the scroll bar which just works with the text quite fitting to a web developers portfolio, perhaps live links to his prior projects would be appropriate as thats usually the first question a client asks of.

            <h3>Saxons Place <a href="https://saxons.place/" class="fa fa-tag"></a></h3>

            <p>
                I think its appropriate to compare two portfolio websites. This website is certainly aimed at presenting this artists illustrations over his qualifications. This is a definitive contact sheet included at the footer which means this is certainly intended for live use on the web.

            </p>

            <p>
                If Im being honest I perceived the moving backgrounds and imagery around the subheadings as interactive buttons, for this reason I think it doesnt quite fit the intended purpose of presenting his portfolio. Upon clicking on each photo there was a lag time between a jolty larger version of the image loading which doesnt compliment the immersion the web developer initally grabs your interest with.

            </p>

             <p>
                Aesthetically this website is gorgeous, upon deeper investigation I found some illustrations to have moving qualities to them, even if they were just shifts in colour. The type is certainly quirkey and casual which compliments this artists work. Over all fantastic theme to it.

            <h3>Brenner Cycles <a href="www.brenner-cycles.de" class="fa fa-tag"></a></h3>

            <p>
                In terms of web-safe colours many web designs opt to use these because they're universal, every computer will be able to render one of the choosen 216 web safe colours as apposed to a discoloured anomoly. I found this website to have done just that, Im quite sure of this because the website is dutch and I was prompted for a well translated option upon loading the website. Colours such as Matte Grey which is used for the subheading I believe to be #222222 are also easy on the eye for extended periods of reading.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've discovered image formats such as .png and .gif are suitable for web design because of the sheer small size of the files. Brenners Website uses .jpeg files from what I could find out. A smaller file size means a website will load faster in the browser.
            </p>

            <p>
                Web fonts are not pre installed on most computer systems, they come from a third party cdn like Googlefonts and a system font from what Ive gathered uses raster graphics which if zoomed in distorts the text. This website maintains its font size even zoomed in at 500%. I can interestingly give an example of a raster graphics system font because the brenner cycles logo becomes distorted upon zooming in by 500%.

            <p>
                This website is not an example of fixed Layout, but rather re-sizable content which has a series of break off points. 1060px wide and 960 px then finally 610px which I imagine works well on a phone screen. I have use utilised this with my Internet Technologies Website using the bootstrap layout.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now if this where a fixed layout page the running banner would cease to work effectively without scrolling for side to side.

            <p>
                This website interestingly has a couple cut off points for which the containers only span as far as two horizontally at which point it creates empty white space at the cut off of 1330px and larger.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also found that upon clicking on an illustration the layout becomes inconsistant and the website spans on container across which is confusing to a viewer.

            <p>
                I think this websites colour impacts the users experience, specifically the colour combination of white and blue its complimentary to the imagery on the home page and the text. Initially I thought white text against a mountainous background looked bad but once you start scrolling a banner appears and changes the colours text to a more appropriately bold black, making a clear indication to the initially hidden user interface.
            </p>

             <p>
                More specifically the navigation acts as a rollover to each section of a long infographic, initially its hidden which I've come to understand was a design decision to make the home page more appealing.
            </p>

             <p>
                In terms of fonts, I find everything readable, perhaps the maps are too small for older readers which could have been considered. But considering there are nine sub headings in the banner I like the font size used for each heading. Everythings scalable too.
            </p>

             <p>
                It seems the text and other contents are working around the background specifically, complimenting the general flow.
            </p>

             <p>
                This website is meant to be scrolled, but if absolutely necessary the banners links can we clicked when they're somewhat hidden over the mountains.

            <h3>Creative People  <a href="https://format.com/creative-people" class="fa fa-tag"></a></h3>

            <p>
                This website has made a very creative timeline for which the background colour changes according to the time of day you've scrolled to, light colours being early and purple being about 12:30pm. The colour change is seamless as well. The one thing I dont like though is the use of colour and styling on the links, theres very poor navigation.
            </p>

             <p>
                More on navigation, as I said earlier the navigation is very poor and shoved in the corners of the website, both working links but only one brings you to another aspect of the page, the About section. But it does follow the same theme as the last websites where one scrolls down the entire time.
            </p>

             <p>
                The fonts I find to be very light, the spacing is respective of readibilty on a computer screen but you have to squint to read much of it at 100% zoom, I found the previous website to be much better at presenting text.
            </p>

             <p>
                The background has a lot going on at once, icons shift as you scroll which leads me to believe not much consideration was taken to layout the text containers about the background icons. Some icons even overlap the text.
            </p>

             <p>
                This is very much a scroll to see important content website, I'd much prefer a dedicated banner like the last websites had.

            <h3>Broadband Speeds and Files</h3>

            <p>
                Broadband speeds vary very much on what you as an individual pay/month. This can range from £4.00 to £30.00 depending on what package offer you opt for and what download speeds you can expect. For example, 50mb/sec On Virgin Medias exclusive deal for my areas works out at £4.00.
            </p>

             <p>
                Reducing file footprints can mean less strain on network providers and cuts the cost of running huge server spaces, its important to discard duplicated pieces of work along with compressing files.
            </p>

             <p>
                File caching is a process of storing information temporarily to better the speed and access times of a program or operating system for example Chrome uses browser cache to improve performance. Sometimes caching can be a bad thing.

            <h3>How it Works</h3>

            <p>
                Voice over IP (VoIP) is a methodology and group of technologies for the delivery of voice communications and multimedia sessions over Internet Protocol (IP) networks, such as the Internet. <a

            <h3>Hardware requirements</h3>

            <p>
                IP Phones and VoIP telephone adapters connect to routers or cable modems which typically depend on the availability of mains electricity or locally generated power.[30] Some VoIP service providers use customer premises equipment (e.g., cablemodems) with battery-backed power supplies to assure uninterrupted service for up to several hours in case of local power failures. Such battery-backed devices typically are designed for use with analog handsets.

            <h3>Popular software for VOIP</h3>

            <p>
                Alcatel, Avaya and Nortel are traditional suppliers with a heritage of legacy products that migrated to IP, they're trying to keep their existing customers in the fold by offering IP PBXes that carry VoIP. Companies like 3Com also focused heavily on hardware-based voice communications, while at the lower end of the enterprise market, you'll find organisations like Mitel, Suretel, and Panasonic.

            <h3>Benefits of VOIP Over Traditional Telephony</h3>

            <p>
                Internet telephony does more than increase savings by lowering costs. It also enables the user to integrate software programs, such as e-mail, e-fax, and remote conferencing over the Internet via the telephone. In other words, a VoIP user can speak to somebody over the phone while accessing other applications, including the Internet simultaneously. VoIP installation requires little technical know-how. In fact, the easy installation process and mobility of the VoIP system offers a high advantage over traditional telephones. Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology can increase the overall productivity of an organization by allowing their employees to multi-task without interruption.

            <h3>Adobe Flash Software and History</h3>

            <p>
                Adobe Flash (formerly called Macromedia Flash and Shockwave Flash) is a multimedia and software platform
                used for creating vector graphics, animation, browser games, rich Internet applications, desktop
                applications, mobile applications and mobile games. Flash displays text, vector and raster graphics to
                provide animations, video games and applications. It allows streaming of audio and video, and can
                capture mouse, keyboard, microphone and camera input.

            <h3>Flash Video and Usability Issues</h3>

            <p>
                Flash Video is a container file format used to deliver video over the Internet using Adobe Flash Player
                version 6 and newer. The reliance on Adobe for decoding Flash makes its use on the World Wide Web a
                concern—the completeness of its public specifications are debated, and no complete implementation of
                Flash is publicly available in source code form with a license that permits reuse. Generally, public
                specifications are what makes a format re-implementable (see future proofing data storage), and reusable
                codebases can be ported to new platforms without the endorsement of the format creator. Flash content is
                usually embedded using the object or embed HTML element. A web browser that does not fully implement one
                of these elements displays the replacement text, if supplied by the web page. Often, a plugin is
                required for the browser to fully implement these elements.
